# Particulate matter matters
Particulate matter (PM) or particulates – are microscopic solid or liquid matter. PM of a size between 2.5 and 10 micrometres (μm) are a WHO group 1 carcinogen. In plain English - very cancerous. "In 2013, a study involving 312,944 people in nine European countries revealed that there was no safe level of particulates and that for every increase of 10 μg/m3 in PM10, the lung cancer rate rose 22%. The smaller PM2.5 were particularly deadly, with a 36% increase in lung cancer per 10 μg/m3 as it can penetrate deeper into the lungs."

So PM is bad, bad bad and you should know how much of it is in the air you breathe.

# Project scope
This project attempts to quantify PM using a network of cheap COTS (commercial off the shelf) sensors. You will find everything to buy, build and run a sensor. You would not be reading this README.md without the work of the original team, http://luftdaten.info/feinstaubsensor-bauen/ and https://github.com/opendata-stuttgart/feinstaub-map. I am very grateful for the work these teams have done. 

This is the first US-installed sensor in Portland, Oregon: https://opensensemap.org/explore/58d82cf2b69fac0011215087, measuring temperature in Celcius, humidity and PM2.5 and PM10.

# Project purpose
The purpose of this repository is to equip you with a checklist and steps. You should be able to get your sensor running within half hour if you have all parts.
